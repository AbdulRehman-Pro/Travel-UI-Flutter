## Shared Preferences

The `shared_preferences` package is used to store user preferences locally. This allows the app to remember user settings across sessions.

## Parallax Animation

The parallax effect is achieved using a custom `ParallaxFlowDelegate`. This creates a smooth and visually appealing animation for the UI components.
